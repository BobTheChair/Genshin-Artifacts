todo list i guess???

settings on mobile

more animated ui (css transitions)
better scrollbar more like the ingame one

more settings
-rarity
-pick mainstat
-pick substats
-lock settings based the other selected settings
--add an option to allow impossible combinations, like 5 star adventurers set with healing bonus on a flower

probably make a better select

show upgraded substats similar to when you upgrade an artifact ingame
